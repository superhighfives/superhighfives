# Hello, I'm Charlie.

### I’m a user interface / user experience lead at [Salesforce](https://salesforce.com).

Before that I looked after design and front-end development for the London-based crowdfunding publisher [Unbound](http://unbound.com/) and the Melbourne-based social film site [Goodfil.ms](http://goodfil.ms/), and was the technical lead of the [Clemenger BBDO](https://www.clemengerbbdo.com.au/en) ad&nbsp;agency.

I studied design and computer science, and I like the space between art and code. I also enjoy the blind terror of the creative process, solving difficult problems, and a clean sheet of&nbsp;paper.

I cannot skateboard. I tried, but it was a whole&nbsp;thing.

In my spare time I like to work on micro projects, from [tools for creative coding](https://sandpitjs.com/), to [tweet-based music videos](http://tweetflight.wearebrightly.com/), to [design-focused macOS apps](https://superhighfives.com/pika). I also like to [write about web development](https://medium.com/superhighfives), contribute to [open source](http://github.com/superhighfives/), and share [design resources](https://dribbble.com/superhighfives).

My work has been featured by Google’s Creative Sandbox, and has received numerous awards, including from [Awwwards](https://thefwa.com/profiles/charlie-gleason) and [the&nbsp;FWA](https://thefwa.com/profiles/charlie-gleason).

I believe there are very few things that can’t be made easier with good documentation.
